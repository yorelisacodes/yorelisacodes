I am a Latinx with experience in customer service and operations, who pivoted into tech. I have so much to offer in this field and with my attention to detail I could be an asset to your team. Please ask me about my first project with JavaScript which is the to-do list. I would talk you through my code.

Curently I am 🌱 learning about Node.js, Express and MongoDB. You could reach me via linkedIn or my Portfolio, both links are in my Bio.

-⚡ Fun fact: I have bungee jumped and would love to skydive one day! 
-🔭 I’m currently working on my bundle thriftstore app for women entrepreneur by women
