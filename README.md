I am a Latinx with experience in customer service and operations, who pivoted into tech. I have so much to offer in this field and with my attention to detail I could be an asset to your team. Please ask me about my first project with JavaScript which is the slot machine. 

Curently I am ðŸŒ± learning about Object Oriented Programming.You could reach me via linkedIn or my Portfolio, both links are in my Bio.

-âš¡ Fun fact: I have bungee jumped and would love to skydive one day!
